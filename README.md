# Grocery Store Transaction Record-Keeping System 

This project is a Java implementation of a system for recording transactions at a grocery store.  The project was an assignment for CSC668 (Advanced Object-Oriented Programming) at San Francisco State University.  

This assignment was an opportunity to get more experience with several useful concepts: abstraction; data encapsulation; inheritance; and polymorphism.
