# Grocery Store Transaction Record-Keeping System 

## Introduction

This project is a Java implementation of a system for recording transactions at a grocery store.  The project was an assignment for CSC668/868 (Advanced Object-Oriented Programming) at San Francisco State University.  

This assignment was an opportunity to get more experience with several useful concepts relating to object-oriented programming: 
- abstraction
- encapsulation
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- class cohesion

The record-keeping system maintains a database of inventory items available for purchase at the store.  Methods of payment including cash, credit, and debit are available.  A very simple user interface is provided.  (This project is intended as an educational exercise rather than a fully functional application.)
